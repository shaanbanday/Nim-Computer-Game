# Nim-Computer-Game
Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles.
The rules of the game are as follows, there are a number of stones to start with. This can range anywhere from 15-30 stones.
Then the user must select 1, 2, or 3 stones to take from the pile. The computer then goes and selects 1, 2, or 3 randomly, except when 
there is 4, 3, or 2 stones left. In that case, the computer will play smart, and try to win the game. The game is won if the opposing
player takes the final stone.
